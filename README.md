# SFSCP-Project
 This is a javascript application to optimize and assist undergraduate college students' class schedules by setting a platform in which students visually map out what classes they want to register. By redefining USFCA's old-fashioned and unintuitive system of registering, our SFSCP group intends to build a useful visual supplement to build more confidence into new students who feel overwhelmed by what classes to take. We strive to integrate this system to be provided by CASA and major advisors in USFCA, ensuring undergraduate students will not feel inundated when transitioning to college but rather feel empowered and at ease when choosing classes while using this readily accessible, MVP application.
